### **Project Overview**

In this project, we built a Dashboard to illustrate overview of bike-share offered by Cyclistic (a fictional company) from Jan 2023 to May 2023. The goal of Dashboard is to help a marketing time to discover how casual and member use Cyclistic bikes differently to create a marketing campaign targeting the casual segment.  Data used was extracting from file **clean_td** - csv file which was retrieved from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whitanyaalexander/google-data-analytics-capstone-cyclistic-2023/code)
